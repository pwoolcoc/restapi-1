# Rest API #1

This was written with node.js v0.12.7. It requires no external
dependencies aside from a working node.js installation. If you have
`npm`, you can run the server with the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

While the server is running, in another terminal, you can run the
tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```

If you do not have `npm`, just run `node index.js` to run the server,
and `node tests.js` to run the tests.
